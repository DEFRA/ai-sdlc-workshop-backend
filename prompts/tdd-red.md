I have provided you with a Product Requirements document(PRD). Please analyze the features and User Stories and implement Feature []. 

I want to use strict test-driven development. Please write the failing tests first, then we'll write code to make it pass. Do not write any implementation code until I've reviewed the test.

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly:
1. RED: Write a failing test
2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green

Start with step 1 only

Write failing tests for the Feature. Show me:
1. The test code
2. Why it will fail
3. What error message we'd expect

Test-First Reasoning:
Before writing any implementation, walk me through:
- What behavior should this test verify?
- What would make this test pass?
- What assumptions am I making?
